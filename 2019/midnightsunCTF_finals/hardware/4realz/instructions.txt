Instructions for the HW challenge

Channel suggested settings settings
CH1 - AC - 50mV
CH2 - DC - 1.0V

Horizontal: 2.00ms

Trigger: on channel 2, rising edge, >1.0V

To communicate to the target:
  Serial port with the Following parameters: 9600-8-N-1
  command syntax is the Following
  p[hex-plaintext]\n - encrypts the plaintext
    Reply
    Reply is made by two parts: one ack and the encypted ciphertext.
    The ack can be collected to analyze the response or scrapped.
    The reply is always 34 characters long and is followed by the ack.

  The commands need to a ascii string of 16bytes representing the payload in hex.
  example of plaintext: pAEF634FEFF30BA500203CAA8998C003B\n

  Before sending the plaintext always issue the x command. This clears the
  buffer and puts the device under test back in a known state.

Remember to plug in the USB memory in the scope before triggering the acquisition.



When you recover the key you can extract the flag from this encrypted message
