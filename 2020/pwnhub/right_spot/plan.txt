1. Exploit signed comparison to write unlimited to mmapped section of heap
2. Write smth smwhere (where???) (PIE!!!)
3. Redirect execution to ROP chain (where???) (PIE!!!)
4. ROP chain writes 'pwned!\n' to STDOUT and exits nicely with 0

write consecutives chunks of 0x5f bytes:
there 0x4
'Y' * 0x14
there 0x4
'Y' * 0x14
there 0x4
'Y' * 0x14
there 0x4
'Y' * 0x13
